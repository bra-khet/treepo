## Where things stand

Phase 0 — workspace and determinism foundation — is built and green.

| Gate | Command | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Build | `cargo build --workspace` | green on Windows; Linux/macOS await first CI run |
| Tests | `cargo test -p treepo-det` | green — 38 unit tests + 1 doctest |
| Lint | `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` | green |
| Format | `cargo fmt --all -- --check` | green |
| `N6` | `cargo xtask dep-guard` | green |
| `N2` | `cargo deny check` | green — advisories, bans, licences, sources |
| `AC-DET-1` | `cargo xtask determinism` | green — 5 probes × 3 runs |
| `AC-DET-2` | determinism.yml compare job | **pending first CI run** |

### The one thing not yet proven

`AC-DET-2` — bit-identical trig across Windows, macOS and Linux — cannot be closed from a
single machine. The harness, the workflow, and the comparison are in place and the compare
step was exercised locally against both matching and deliberately mismatched reports. What
remains is pushing to a remote and letting the three runners disagree or not.

Everything about the design says they will agree: the trig path is integer-only, the report
is written with LF on every platform, and debug and release builds already produce identical
reports on Windows. But it is unproven until CI says so, and it is the single highest-value
thing to confirm before Phase 1 builds on it.

### Reference digests (Windows, release and debug alike)

```

`trig` is also pinned as a golden-digest unit test inside `treepo-det::trig`, so an
accidental edit to the sine table fails `cargo test`, not just CI.

**Any change to these numbers changes every tree treepo will ever generate.**

### Trig precision — locked 2026-07-27

The 1025-entry table with linear interpolation (absolute error under `3 × 10⁻⁷`) was reviewed
against the alternative of a wider table or a small-angle correction term, and **kept as
built**. The residual is below the L-system noise floor (`F-SKEL-4`) and far below the scale
at which `P6` aggregation moves a limb; the extra precision would buy nothing a viewer could
see, and Phase 3 will tune the parameter row against these exact values.

Frozen, along with the golden digests above. Reopening it is a recorded decision plus a
harness run on either side — not a code edit.

---

## What exists

```
Cargo.toml  rust-toolchain.toml  clippy.toml  deny.toml  .cargo/config.toml
.gitattributes                       # LF pinning — see note below
.github/workflows/{ci,determinism}.yml
crates/treepo-det/src/{lib,fixed,trig,rng,hash,ordered}.rs
xtask/src/{main,determinism,dep_guard}.rs
```

Two deviations from the architecture's file tree, both deliberate:

1. **`.gitattributes` is new.** From Phase 3 the pipeline reads `assets/params/*.ron`. A file
   checked out CRLF on Windows and LF elsewhere is a different file, so any hash of its bytes
   differs by platform — an `AC-DET-2` failure with no visible cause. Build and asset files
   are pinned to LF; `*.md` is excluded so the ratified docs do not renormalize.
2. **This file.** Session handoff, not a v1 deliverable.

## Decisions taken during the build

Recorded because they are not in the architecture and someone will otherwise re-open them.

- **`treepo-det` is `no_std`.** Not portability — it makes `std::time` and
  `std::collections::HashMap` *unreachable* from the crate every generated value flows
  through. The lint bans are the second line of defence, not the first.
- **`Fx` arithmetic saturates.** Rust's `+` panics on overflow in debug and wraps in release.
  For a determinism type that is a build-profile-dependent result, which is the exact bug
  class the crate exists to eliminate. Division is the exception and panics on a zero divisor,
  since that is a caller bug rather than an extreme input; `checked_div` is there for callers
  who expect one.
- **`Angle` is a binary angle** — full turn = 2³². Rotation wraps exactly, never drifts, and
  needs no range reduction. Quadrant reflection then makes the sine symmetries
  (`sin(-a) == -sin(a)`, `cos(-a) == cos(a)`) exact rather than approximate.
- **The RNG has no `split()`, on purpose.** Child seeds come from `Seed::derive(label)`, so a
  path's seed is a function of its path and not of traversal order. With a stream-split, adding
  one file near the top of a repository would re-seed everything after it and reshape the whole
  tree — `AC-GROW-4` would be unachievable.
- **SHA-256 rather than a fast non-cryptographic hash.** Manifest keys and store directory
  names must mean the same thing for the life of the product; `DefaultHasher` explicitly does
  not. Cost is irrelevant on the rare side of `P10`.
- **Constants are generated, not transcribed.** The sine table came from exact
  arbitrary-precision evaluation; the SHA-256 tables from exact integer roots. Each is then
  checked against an independent published vector — RFC 8439 for the ChaCha core at 20 rounds,
  the standard `""`/`"abc"` digests for SHA-256, and the platform `libm` for the trig table
  within its stated interpolation bound. No constant in the crate rests on being typed
  correctly.

## Next

**Phase 1 — model & repository extraction.** Depends only on Phase 0.

Before building on it: the campaign flags a **spike first** on RISK-A — validate that `gix`
can produce per-file line counts over the commit graph efficiently enough for `F-EXT-2`, against
the T2 fixture, *before* the extraction layer is written on top of it. If the spike fails, the
campaign says stop and escalate rather than quietly falling back to subprocess `git`, because
that fallback trades away `R1` (no git binary on a consumer machine) and widens `N1`.

`cargo xtask dep-guard` already lists `treepo-model` and `treepo-vcs` as absent, so it will
start checking them the moment they exist.
